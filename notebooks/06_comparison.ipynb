    "   rate that allows the classification layer to efficiently adapt to the new task without \n",

    "\n",
    "3. Efficient parameter utilization: By freezing the convolutional backbone and only training \n",

    "Our exploration of different approaches to Fashion-MNIST classification has yielded several \n",
    "important insights about deep learning strategies for image classification tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "Transfer learning provides a substantial performance advantage over training from scratch, \n",
    "even when the source and target domains differ. The pretrained ResNet18 models significantly \n",
    "outperformed our custom CNN despite only training the final layer, demonstrating that the \n",
    "general visual features learned from ImageNet transfer effectively to fashion item classification. \n",
    "This finding suggests that for many practical applications with limited data, leveraging \n",
    "pretrained models should be the default approach rather than designing custom architectures \n",
    "from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hyperparameter tuning, even of a single parameter like learning rate, can yield meaningful \n",
    "performance improvements. The modest but significant gain achieved by our tuned model highlights \n",
    "the importance of this often-overlooked step in the deep learning workflow. For transfer learning \n",
    "scenarios where only the final layers are trained, the learning rate is particularly impactful \n",
    "as it controls how quickly the model adapts to the new task without disturbing the valuable \n",
    "pretrained features.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Fashion-MNIST dataset presents specific challenges that reflect real-world computer vision \n",
    "problems. All models struggled most with distinguishing between visually similar categories \n",
    "(like shirts vs. t-shirts or different types of footwear), mirroring the challenges faced in \n",
    "practical applications. The error analysis revealed that even the best models make mistakes \n",
    "that would be challenging for humans given the low-resolution, grayscale nature of the images.\n",
    "\n",
    "The performance-efficiency tradeoff is evident in our results. While the pretrained models \n",
    "achieved higher accuracy, the scratch CNN required training significantly fewer parameters \n",

    "Dataset Limitations:\n",
    "- Fashion-MNIST's low resolution (28×28) and grayscale format limit the visual information \n",
    "  available to the models, creating an artificial ceiling on performance\n",
    "- The dataset lacks texture and material information that would be crucial for real-world \n",
    "  fashion classification\n",
    "- The clean, centered images with uniform backgrounds don't reflect the challenges of \n",
    "  real-world deployment scenarios with varied lighting, backgrounds, and viewpoints\n",
    "- The fixed set of 10 categories is relatively small compared to commercial fashion \n",
    "  taxonomies with hundreds of categories and subcategories\n",
    "\n",
    "Computational Constraints:\n",
    "- Training was limited to 10 epochs per model, which may have prevented the scratch CNN \n",
    "  from reaching its full potential\n",
    "- Hyperparameter tuning was restricted to learning rate only, leaving other potentially \n",

    "- The experiments were conducted on consumer-grade hardware, limiting the scale and scope \n",
    "  of architecture exploration\n",
    "- Memory constraints prevented testing larger batch sizes or more complex architectures\n",

    "Validation Methodology:\n",
    "- The fixed train/validation/test split, while ensuring fair comparison, doesn't account \n",
    "  for potential data distribution shifts\n",
    "- The evaluation metrics (accuracy, F1) treat all misclassifications equally, whereas in \n",
    "  real applications, some errors might be more costly than others\n",
    "- The lack of confidence calibration analysis means we don't know if the models' probability \n",
